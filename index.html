        Hi there, my name is Jack Spence and I'm a 21-year-old full stack
        developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. I'm currently studying BCOM
        Marketing at Red and Yellow Creative School of Business, but my passion
        for programming has led me to pursue a career in this field. I believe
        that programming has the ability to simplify everyday life and I have a
        strong drive to constantly improve my skills. Currently, Iâ€™m enrolled in
        a full stack developer bootcamp, where I'm learning a range of
        programming languages and tools. In addition to my technical abilities,
        I have good problem-solving skills, which I believe are essential in any
        programming role. My current programming abilities include HTML and CSS,
        and I'm excited to continue expanding my skill set. Personally, I'm a
        determined and persistent individual, motivated to help improve the
        world one program at a time. Outside of programming, I have a love for
        golf and play regularly. I also enjoy collaborating with others, and I'm
        always looking for new opportunities to work with like-minded
        individuals. Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit more about me,
        and I'm excited to see what the future holds in mv career as a full
        stack developer!
