          Hi there, my name is Jack Spence and I'm a 21-year-old full stack
          developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. I'm currently studying
          BCOM Marketing at Red and Yellow Creative School of Business, but my
          passion for programming has led me to pursue a career in this field. I
          believe that programming has the ability to simplify everyday life and
          I have a strong drive to constantly improve my skills. Currently, Iâ€™m
          enrolled in a full stack developer bootcamp, where I'm learning a
          range of programming languages and tools. In addition to my technical
          abilities, I have good problem-solving skills, which I believe are
          essential in any programming role. My current programming abilities
          include HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to continue expanding my skill
          set. Personally, I'm a determined and persistent individual, motivated
          to help improve the world one program at a time. Outside of
          programming, I have a love for golf and play regularly. I also enjoy
          collaborating with others, and I'm always looking for new
          opportunities to work with like-minded individuals. Thanks for taking
          the time to learn a bit more about me, and I'm excited to see what the
          future holds in mv career as a full stack developer!
